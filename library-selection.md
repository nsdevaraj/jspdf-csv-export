# PDF Library Selection for Large CSV Data Export

## Requirements
- Handle large CSV datasets (potentially hundreds of thousands of rows)
- Export as a single PDF file
- Memory-efficient processing
- Browser-based implementation
- Streaming/chunking capability

## Library Evaluation

### jsPDF (Selected)
- **Version**: 3.0.0 (Latest)
- **Pros**:
  - Well-maintained with 30k+ stars on GitHub
  - Works in both Node.js and browser environments
  - Has TypeScript support
  - Supports custom fonts
  - The `html` function in newer versions writes tables as text instead of creating images, avoiding canvas size limitations
  - No data limits in the library itself (browser canvas limitations are the constraint)
  - Compression support through pako library (replaced Deflater)
  - Good documentation and community support
- **Cons**:
  - Imperative API can make complex layouts challenging
  - Memory issues reported with large datasets (100,000+ rows)
  - Browser canvas size limitations

### pdf-lib
- **Pros**:
  - Implemented entirely in TypeScript
  - Good performance
  - Support for Unit8Array and ArrayBuffer for font files
  - PDF merging, splitting, embedding capabilities
- **Cons**:
  - Imperative approach makes complex layouts difficult
  - Less community adoption than jsPDF

### pdfmake
- **Pros**:
  - Declarative approach (easier to define what you want)
  - Built on PDFKit
- **Cons**:
  - Issues with custom fonts when using Webpack
  - Less suitable for streaming implementation

## Decision
jsPDF (version 3.0.0) has been selected as the most appropriate library for implementing a streaming solution for large CSV data export. The decision is based on:

1. **Wide adoption and support**: jsPDF has the highest number of stars among PDF libraries on GitHub, indicating strong community support.

2. **HTML function capability**: The `html` function in newer versions allows writing tables as text instead of images, which helps avoid canvas size limitations.

3. **Browser compatibility**: Works well in modern browsers (dropped IE support in v3.0.0).

4. **Flexibility**: Can be adapted for chunked processing to handle large datasets.

## Implementation Strategy
To overcome the memory limitations when handling large CSV datasets:

1. Implement a chunked processing mechanism that:
   - Processes CSV data in small batches
   - Generates PDF content incrementally
   - Uses Web Workers for background processing

2. Use the `html` function instead of canvas-based approaches to avoid browser canvas size limitations.

3. Implement progress tracking to provide feedback during the potentially lengthy processing time.

4. Add error handling and recovery mechanisms to manage potential failures during processing.
