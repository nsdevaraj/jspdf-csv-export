/**
 * Performance Optimizations for jsPDF CSV Streaming Implementation
 * 
 * This file documents the performance optimizations implemented to improve
 * memory efficiency and processing speed when handling large CSV datasets.
 */

// Memory Usage Optimization
const memoryOptimizations = {
  // 1. Chunk-based processing
  chunkProcessing: {
    description: "Process CSV data in small chunks rather than loading the entire file",
    implementation: "Using PapaParse's streaming capabilities with configurable chunk sizes",
    benefit: "Prevents memory overflow by keeping only a small portion of data in memory at once"
  },
  
  // 2. Object cleanup
  objectCleanup: {
    description: "Explicitly release references to large objects when no longer needed",
    implementation: "Setting processed chunks to null after use and using proper scoping",
    benefit: "Helps JavaScript garbage collector reclaim memory more efficiently"
  },
  
  // 3. Typed arrays
  typedArrays: {
    description: "Use typed arrays for binary data operations",
    implementation: "Leveraging Uint8Array for binary operations where appropriate",
    benefit: "More memory-efficient than regular arrays for binary data"
  }
};

// Processing Speed Optimization
const speedOptimizations = {
  // 1. Debounced UI updates
  debouncedUpdates: {
    description: "Limit frequency of UI updates during processing",
    implementation: "Update progress indicators at controlled intervals rather than for every row",
    benefit: "Reduces DOM manipulation overhead and improves overall performance"
  },
  
  // 2. Asynchronous processing
  asyncProcessing: {
    description: "Use asynchronous processing with small delays",
    implementation: "Implementing setTimeout and Promise-based delays between chunks",
    benefit: "Prevents browser UI freezing and allows for better user experience"
  },
  
  // 3. Optimized PDF generation
  optimizedPdfGeneration: {
    description: "Optimize PDF generation by minimizing redundant operations",
    implementation: "Calculating styles once, reusing calculations, and batching similar operations",
    benefit: "Reduces processing overhead during PDF generation"
  }
};

// Browser-Specific Optimizations
const browserOptimizations = {
  // 1. Feature detection
  featureDetection: {
    description: "Detect browser capabilities and adjust processing accordingly",
    implementation: "Check for memory limits, Web Worker support, and streaming capabilities",
    benefit: "Provides optimal experience across different browsers and devices"
  },
  
  // 2. Adaptive chunk sizing
  adaptiveChunkSizing: {
    description: "Dynamically adjust chunk size based on browser performance",
    implementation: "Start with conservative chunk size and adjust based on processing time",
    benefit: "Balances memory usage and processing speed for optimal performance"
  }
};

// Web Worker Implementation
const webWorkerOptimization = {
  description: "Offload heavy processing to background threads",
  implementation: "Move CSV parsing and data transformation to Web Workers",
  benefit: "Keeps UI responsive during intensive processing operations",
  limitations: "Cannot directly access DOM, requires message passing",
  applicability: "Best for CPU-intensive operations like data transformation"
};

// Memory Leak Prevention
const memoryLeakPrevention = {
  // 1. Event listener cleanup
  eventListenerCleanup: {
    description: "Properly remove event listeners when no longer needed",
    implementation: "Track and remove all event listeners in cleanup functions",
    benefit: "Prevents memory leaks from orphaned event listeners"
  },
  
  // 2. Closure management
  closureManagement: {
    description: "Be mindful of closures that may retain large objects",
    implementation: "Avoid creating closures that reference large data structures",
    benefit: "Prevents unintentional memory retention"
  }
};

// Implementation Notes
/**
 * The optimizations above have been implemented in the following files:
 * 
 * 1. csv-parser.js:
 *    - Chunk-based processing
 *    - Object cleanup
 *    - Adaptive chunk sizing
 * 
 * 2. pdf-generator.js:
 *    - Optimized PDF generation
 *    - Memory leak prevention
 * 
 * 3. app.js:
 *    - Debounced UI updates
 *    - Asynchronous processing
 *    - Feature detection
 *    - Event listener cleanup
 * 
 * These optimizations allow the application to handle CSV files with
 * 100,000+ rows while maintaining reasonable memory usage and
 * responsive user interface.
