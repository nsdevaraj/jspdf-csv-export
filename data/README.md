# Sample CSV Data for Testing

This directory contains sample CSV files for testing the CSV to PDF streaming implementation.

## Files:

1. `small.csv` - A small CSV file (100 rows) for basic testing
2. `medium.csv` - A medium-sized CSV file (1,000 rows) for functionality testing
3. `large.csv` - A large CSV file (10,000+ rows) for performance testing

## Usage:

These files can be used to test the CSV to PDF streaming functionality at different scales to ensure the implementation handles various file sizes correctly.
